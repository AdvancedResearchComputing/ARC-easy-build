0. Search for BirdNET: eb -S ^birdnet
1. Download easyconfig & patch for BirdNET
2. Look at dependencies and searched for them with eb -S
3. Download easyconfig for missing dependency: librosa
4. Ran eb -Dr to do a dry run
5. Everything looked good, so we did eb -r to try to install everything
6. NCCL failed to find the source so we manually downloaded it to /apps/easybuild/sources/n/NCCL
7. Bonus step: Edit EASYBUILD_ROBOT_PATHS to include current directory so BirdNET finds librosa
8. Victory (we hope): eb -r BirdNET... to install everything

Updating EasyBuild would have done (1) and (3) for us so that (0) would have found the easyconfig and dry run eb -Dr would have looked fine. Still would have had the NCCL problem in (6) though.
